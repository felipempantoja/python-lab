Just a bunch of python code to learn a little bit this nice language...

## Tic Tac Toe
> Status: Working

- [x] Create the game
- [x] Validate invalid inputs
- [x] Validade repeated moves
- [x] Show results in the end
- [x] Clear output after every move, showing redrawn board
- [x] Offer new game after current's end
- [ ] Refactoring


## Binary Gap
> Spoiler alert: If you did not solve this algorithm yet, I suggest you try there before look at my code

- [x] Pythonic version (lots of syntatic suggars to reduce code)
- [x] Agnostic version (more verbose version, however using less magic builtin functions)


## Blackjack
> Status: Pretty much working
